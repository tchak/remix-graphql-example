# Remix GraphQL Example

## What is it?

GraphQL schema is defined using [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com) and then used in [remix](https://remix.run) loaders through [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) client (with `exchange-execute`) to build UI. The same schema is also exposed under `/graphql` resource route through [envelop](https://www.envelop.dev) and [helix](https://github.com/contra/graphql-helix).

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
